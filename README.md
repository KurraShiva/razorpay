This project demonstrates a complete Razorpay payment integration using Spring Boot. It supports creating orders, verifying payments, capturing payments, processing refunds, and fetching payment/order details from both the database and Razorpay APIs. The application uses MySQL for persistence, JPA/Hibernate for ORM, and follows a clean layered architecture with Controller, Service, Repository, and Entity layers. It is designed to simulate a real-world e-commerce payment flow and can be easily extended for production use.
